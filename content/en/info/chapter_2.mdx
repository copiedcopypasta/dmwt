# Energy-Saving Settings in the Operating System

There are various ways to easily save energy and computing power.

## Power Saving Mode

Most devices offer the possibility to switch to power saving mode after a set time. Here, the screen is turned off and the PC goes into a standby state where it consumes less energy. It's important not to set a screensaver but to actually let the screen turn off, as a screensaver still displays something on the screen, which costs energy.

## Unused Features and Autostart

By disabling autostart programs that you don't actually need, you can reduce boot time and also ensure that unnecessary background processes don't even start. System functions like WiFi and Bluetooth can also be disabled to save energy when you don't need them. This reduces power consumption and also increases battery life on mobile devices.

## Laptop on AC Power and Battery Operation

On laptops, you can often make power saving behavior dependent on the power supply. For example, you can enter power saving mode earlier on battery power, or when on AC power, only turn off the screen when closed to ensure long installations. Although the latter doesn't make sense permanently for every user.
