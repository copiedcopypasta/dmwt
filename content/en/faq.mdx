## Why "Wizard of OS" (WoOS)?

While Brainstorming about Green IT, we started discussing operating systems.
Everyone in our group had different experiences, and during our exchange, suddenly the pun "Wizard of OS", a play on The Wizard of Oz, popped up.
From there, the rest of the websites concept took shape around that name.

## Do you have more questions?

Currently we haven't been asked much yet but this would be a great place to adress questions that came up during the presentation.
