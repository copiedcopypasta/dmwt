# Repair Devices

As discussed in Chapter 3, every newly purchased device is in principle an environmental burden and requires resources that can hardly or not at all be recovered even in the case of later recycling. Therefore, it's important to try to repair devices that are broken or defective before they are disposed of. If it's a maintainable system, you can often replace individual parts to make the device usable again.

# Refurbished

Refurbished devices are a good way to extend the usage time of a device. Devices are completely overhauled by reputable providers and resold fully functional. This topic is interesting if you no longer have use for an old device that you trust can still be used after some refurbishment, or that simply no longer meets your requirements, but also if you're looking for a device below market price that doesn't have to meet the highest requirements.

If you want to get a refurbished device, you should pay attention to quality and warranty. Reputable providers offer a comprehensive warranty and test the devices thoroughly. It's also advisable to choose devices that are generally known for their longevity, such as business laptops from Lenovo or Dell, which are often more robust and easily maintainable.
