# The Biggest Power Consumers Among PC Components

The various components in a PC have different impacts on the device's power consumption. If you're building a PC yourself or configuring one online, you can save energy in some places depending on your needs.

## CPU

The CPU represents the computer's computing center and virtually always has something to do. Consumption ranges from ~50 watts for simpler models to ~280 watts for modern high-end models. The most important features of a CPU include the number of cores and clock rate. The number of cores indicates how many calculations can be processed simultaneously, mainly important when you have many programs and processes running at the same time. The clock rate indicates how fast a core works - the faster a core, the better or more smoothly it can solve complex tasks. For a gaming computer, you need fewer cores with a high clock rate; for a workstation, more cores with lower clock rates.

## GPU

The graphics card usually has the greatest potential energy consumption in the device. Here we distinguish between idle load and full load in measurements. The simplest models have an idle load of ~10 watts and a full load of ~80 watts. There's virtually no limit upward in terms of price and performance. Current high-end models have an idle load of ~90 watts and a full load of ~750 watts, which however offers completely excessive performance for most users. These high-end GPUs consume more power than typical power supplies deliver and have more RAM built in than is available in most systems.

## Monitor

Unless you have a device with a built-in monitor like a laptop, you can also save quite a bit of power on the monitor. Especially very old CRT monitors have a comparatively high consumption of ~100 watts compared to modern LED monitors with ~10-30 watts. When buying, you should also pay attention to the refresh rate if you value smooth gameplay, as well as an appropriate size so you can see enough, but not too large like a TV, so that your own field of vision is exceeded when sitting in front of it.
