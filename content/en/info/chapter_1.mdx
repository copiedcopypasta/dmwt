# Purchase According to Requirements

Before purchasing a new device, you should consider the requirements - depending on these, various options can be excluded or taken into account.

## Operating System Requirements

Different operating systems have different minimum hardware requirements.

### Windows

While Windows runs with 2 CPU cores, 4 are recommended as many background processes constantly require computing power. For memory, 8GB RAM is the lower limit for smooth operation, and 64GB should be available on the hard drive for the system to be properly utilized. The GPU is needed for a smooth UI - current drivers are important here, otherwise performance is lost.

### MacOS

Things are a bit different here, as MacOS is not installed on self-built devices but is included when purchasing an Apple device. Nevertheless, rough requirements can be stated. MacOS expects modern CPUs with 4-8 cores, although Apple's own M series is often used. RAM is used aggressively in MacOS, which is why 16GB is recommended. For hard drives, you quickly run out of space under 100GB, which is why you need 128GB or more. The GPU is also heavily used by the system, which is why older GPUs quickly feel slow.

### Linux

Since there are different distributions in Linux, there is naturally some variance, so here are the lower values for lightweight systems. Linux runs without problems even on older CPUs with 2 cores, scaling upward is possible but not mandatory. Very light versions of Linux work with less than 4GB RAM, although 8GB is usually comfortable. The Linux base system requires approximately 10-20GB, with programs 30-50GB is sufficient. Linux's GPU requirements are very low, demand only grows if corresponding programs or gaming is planned.

## Personal Requirements

Depending on what you're getting a device for, different parts and their performance are important. If you mainly want to edit text documents or spreadsheets and occasionally surf the internet, a slimmer model is sufficient. Here you can also consider mini-PCs or NUCs, which are cheaper and also consume less power, but usually have relatively few ports. If you want to use demanding software or games, an appropriate CPU and GPU are mandatory. For a gaming computer, you need CPUs with fewer cores and higher clock rates; for a workstation, more cores with lower clock rates. A bit more RAM and storage space won't hurt for demanding tasks, although speed often helps more than raw GB volume. For RAM, speed refers to the MHz rate, which is better with newer generations (DDR4 & DDR5). For storage space, an SSD is also worthwhile for fast results, as these have faster read and write speeds compared to older HDDs.
