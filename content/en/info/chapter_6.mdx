# The Strengths of Different Operating Systems

Each operating system has its own strengths and advantages.

## Windows

As the most widely used operating system, Windows is compatible with most software. Many games run primarily on Windows or were developed for it. With the Office suite, Windows or Microsoft is also the standard in most offices. Generally, Windows is quite an all-rounder.

## MacOS

For content creation, MacOS is somewhat ahead of the competition and is therefore also widely used in this area. Apple's all-in-one product also performs very well in terms of power consumption, especially because all components are well matched to each other and, for example, the new CPU chips of the M series are also from Apple.

## Linux

The various Linux distributions can hardly be lumped together, but a few general facts can be found. Customizability already starts with the selection of the distribution. Linux is strongest when it is used for a specific purpose and the distribution is chosen accordingly.
