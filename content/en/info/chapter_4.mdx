# Use for Longer Instead of Buying New

A new device always requires resources such as precious metals that we as humanity should handle responsibly. Using your current device as long as possible and upgrading when necessary is often better for the environment.

## Maintainable Systems

Desktop PCs are a good example of devices that allow users to replace individual components when needed. Expanding hard drives or RAM usually works without problems. Of course, some prior knowledge is necessary if you want to perform the upgrades yourself. Cascading problems can also occur here, such as a new CPU that requires a different socket, thus a new motherboard is needed which only works with more modern RAM modules. So some upgrades may require multiple parts, but these problems can be avoided or minimized if you buy with foresight.

## Forward-Thinking Purchasing

When acquiring a new device, it is important to think about requirements in advance, as described in Chapter 2. However, it's also worth looking into the technical future. Do I spend a bit more money to have a better CPU socket that a newer CPU will fit on later? Do I take a motherboard with more RAM slots than I actively use to have the option for a RAM upgrade later? Is it worth buying a large case so that larger graphics cards and more hard drives will also fit in the future? These questions naturally involve some market research but can pay off in the long run with high technical requirements.

## No Soldered Batteries

The lifespan of most laptops is often closely related to battery capacity. When the battery can only supply the system briefly or not at all, the mobile aspect of a laptop is quickly lost and the system is usually considered broken. In such cases, a battery replacement can often work wonders. This is simple but only possible as long as the battery is not permanently soldered. If you pay attention to maintainability when buying a laptop, you also have a more energy-efficient device than most desktop PCs.

## OS Switch Instead of New Purchase

Especially Windows users have problems with some operating system updates that their device doesn't meet the requirements of the new version. However, since the usage context usually hasn't changed, this doesn't have to mean the end of the device. Many Linux installations have lower system requirements and offer very comparable functions if you choose the right distribution for yourself. https://distrochooser.de/
